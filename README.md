# CS360MobileArchitectAndProgramming
## A repository for my work completed throughout my CS-360 Mobile Architect &amp; Programming course at Southern New Hampshire University

The Weight-Tracker mobile app was created to provide users with an easy-to-use, motivating tool to track their weight over time. A user-centered experience that promotes accountability without overwhelming users with extraneous features was the goal in mind. Key screens including a home screen that shows logged weights, a form for entering new daily weights, and a goal-tracking view to illustrate progress are all included in the application in order to satisfy this need. Other features, such as SMS messages that congratulate users upon reaching milestones, were added in order to reinforce motivation through positive feedback. With readable typography, unambiguous buttons, and a well-organized structure, the user interface (UI) was purposefully made to be simple and uncluttered, facilitating easy and effective user engagement.

I broke down the functionality into smaller tasks and leveraged Android's lifecycle methods to ensure seamless performance while building the app, concentrating on modularity, readability, and consistent testing. Using the Android Emulator, I tested the app to make sure all of the buttons, screens, and SMS features operated as they should and to see how it performed on various device sizes. Finding minor errors in logic and verifying that permissions were being handled securely and responsibly  was involved in this testing approach. I had to come up with creative ways to manage the SMS feature throughout development in order to comply with Android's more stringent permission rules without sacrificing usability. Integrating the data presentation and input logic was one area in which I excelled, illustrating my developing ability to integrate UI design with useful, user-driven programming.
